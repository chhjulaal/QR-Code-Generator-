            A QR code generator is a tool or software application that creates Quick Response (QR) codes. QR codes are
            two-dimensional barcodes that can store various types of information, such as website URLs, text, contact
            information, or Wi-Fi credentials. Users can generate QR codes by inputting the desired data into the
            generator, which then converts it into a QR code image that can be scanned by smartphones or other devices
            with a QR code reader app. QR codes are commonly used for marketing, advertising, ticketing, product
            packaging, and facilitating quick access to digital content.
